TO-DO
start_streaming.py 
is in working order, but still has one disadvantage that the broadcast is interrupted when a device is added or removed from the available streams. That would be great to fix but if that is too complicated could potentially also be fixed by running some javascript in the on the crying by the sea page to restart the stream.

audio_stream_recorder.py
should be working but I'm not sure if the part that adds new files to the playlist is really working.

config.json is where you set the streams and the port so they don't have to be typed in every time.

fiveminutesago.txt
is just the little ascii art that shows the title and version number in the terminal.
